# Game-of-Life
## A Simple java Command Line interface implementation of Game of Life

### Rules for the Game of Life:
      1. Existing cell dies if fewer than 2 neighbors (underpopulation)
      2. Existing cell lives if 2-3 neighbors ("these neighbors are JUST RIGHT!")
      3. Existing cell dies if greater than 3 neighbors (overpopulation)
      4. Empty cell becomes alive if exactly 3 neighbors (Remains in state)
      
## Running the Program :

- Running the Life.java after compilation will compile & run the program.

- It has a design of two modes:

* Autometic Mode: It automates 10 generations of some random inputs
* Manual : It takes user input cell values 

-  Co-Ordinate System Starting from (0,0) - (r-1)-(c-1)

-  The corresponding generations is calculated in step wise manner -> S to move to next Generation
